          <p>The physical interaction is better when I work online, the feeling of using different materials,<br>
             and each material has its unique texture. To work online is more just a  visual interaction, but work<br> 
             online will be much faster.</p>
          <p><strong>what do you think is the ‘purpose(s)’ of the web?</strong></p>

             You will never know what can happen tomorrow, but the growth of the internet is also a growth of the danger.<br>
             There is no privacy on the internet. For the good part of the,  grow of the internet is the communication<br>
            between people become easier.</p>

             a real product in a quick and cheap way. Web makes everything more accessible and provides a wider audience.<br>
             Web also makes the graphic design more general to the public.</p>

          <p>To learn what is coding and how to coding is helpful, but not all of the graphic designers have to know coding.<br>
             I personally think web design is interesting,and I willing to learn more of the coding to make better designs. </p>
          <p><strong>What is your favorite Adobe program?</strong></p>
          <p>Photoshop, because I like working with images, and I want to work with the magazines,  so image making is important.<br>
